# Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„

'Tis the season! These are my solutions to the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I'm writing these in Elixir to better my skills in the language.

I've written a basic harness for this year:
```
Usage: ./advent_of_code_2022 day_num input_file
```

This harness can be built with `mix escript.build`
